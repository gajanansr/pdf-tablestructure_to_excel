# Scanned PDF to Excel Converter

This repository contains a Python script that converts scanned PDF documents into Excel files while preserving the table structure. It utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately extract data from the scanned PDFs and format it into a structured Excel format.

## Features

- Converts scanned PDFs containing tables into Excel files.
- Maintains the original table structure with merged cells.
- Supports various PDF layouts (landscape and portrait).
- Generates Excel files with highlighted table borders.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
   git clone https://github.com/gajanansr/pdf-tablestructure_to_excel.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
   cd pdf-tablestructure_to_excel
```

3. Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your scanned PDF file in the project directory.
2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python3 process_pdf_to_excel.py
   ```

   Replace `<./Alibagh.pdf>` with the name of your scanned PDF file in the script.

3. After the script completes, an Excel file will be generated in the same directory.
